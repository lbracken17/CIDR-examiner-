CIDR-examiner is an incomplete java program that should take in sets of CIDR blocks and returns a matrix of the degree of interaction
(intersecting, containg, adjacent or none).

CIDR.java is incomplete as the intersecting, containing, and adjacent functions do not work. Matrix.java takes the methods from CIDR.java
and creates a matrix of strings indicating the degree of interaction between two sets of CIDR blocks. 

I would represent the data with a word cloud. It would go through the matrix of strings and represent the frequency of the different 
degrees. The advantage of using a word cloud is that is engaging and easy to understand; you can to clearly see the degree of interaction 
between sets of CIDR blocks. A draw back of work cloud is that it is not perfect and the importance or size of a word can change based on
its length and the white space around the letters.
